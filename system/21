# List all real users on the VM
# Human users have UIDs starting at 1000, so this command
# filters out all the non-humans
# first part list all users and their UIDs
# second part cuts out all under 1000 (will now show
# in my VM something like 'jpartane:1000'
# 3rd part cuts out the 1000 so shows only 'jpartane' 
# and other possible human users.
